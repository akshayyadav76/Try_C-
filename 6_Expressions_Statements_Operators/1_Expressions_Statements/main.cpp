/*
The most basic building block of a program
A Sequence of Operators and Operands that speacify same computation
Compute a value from a number of Operators   like-: (33+55)-(55*2)
  
  
 examples -:   1.5 +1.7 
                     44*20
                      a>b
                      a=b

 //******************Statements***************************\\

/*
  
A complete line of code that perform same action
Usually terminate with semi colon
Usually contain expressions
C++ has many types of Statements
     expression,null,Compund,Selection,Itration,Decleration,Jump,Try and Catch,Others
